# VAC-WEBPAGE
Learnt about Git and Github in detail. Also learnt Git commands.
Got to know how to clone repositories locally from github and commit back it to github.
Used VS code as a local editor. 
Day-1 was really Fun and I gathered a lot of experience. Looking forward to learn a lot of things in upcoming days.
